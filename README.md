Implementation of paper car race game.
Rules of game are simple. In a game we have a squared paper with a road on it. Several peaple participate in it, so each one has car on a start. Each step person can go on a particula lenght, like 5, next step, 5+5, next 5+5+5 etc.But if car hits roads border "spead" decreases do 5 again.
This online version should provide rooms for players (probably max 6 persons per room). Anonymous games. Roads generations.
