# responsive design for mobile

everything is slow on mobile. devices are overloaded

 amazon 100ms  1% revenue increate 17mln$

 bing 1 sec delay revenue drops 2.8%

developer-> sevrer-> internet->telco network-> device->browser
telco isn't reliable

why is slower

 * cpu power
 * browser diffirent
 * batery life preserving
 * memory
 * network
 * latency
 * implementation

loading apple.com = 1.4% procent

4G speeed is not constant

average web site 1.8MB. 65% images, 17% scripts, etc. html and content 3%. its about 7.5 sec. with average speed 2Mb/sec

__avg__ latency per roundtrip 100-200ms

whole total with networks 11.2 second to get page from mobile, no rendering no server response time

google 7.5 second.72 old data

bit.ly/mobile-barrier


`72% responsive as slow and big as old`

`30-40% slower with JS`

When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail

less client more server

**RESS**

- reduce need for client side processing
- eliminate "overdownloading"
- somting else

DDR - device description repository

 - nice plae to store custom stuff
    * business rules
    * specificts to your site

- override feature detection functions

etc.

ddr api

service for image optimization

picturefill

with ress 50% fuster download, 75% faster latency
overrall time only 4% faster
